# Concepts addressed:prompt, shell, directory

~/command-line-5-8-tliapis$ type type
type is a shell builtin
~/command-line-5-8-tliapis$ type ls
ls is /bin/ls
~/command-line-5-8-tliapis$ type cp
cp is /bin/cp
~/command-line-5-8-tliapis$ which ls
/bin/ls
~/command-line-5-8-tliapis$ which cd
~/command-line-5-8-tliapis$ help cd
cd: cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]
    Change the shell working directory.
    
    Change the current directory to DIR.  The default DIR is the value of the
    HOME shell variable.
    
    The variable CDPATH defines the search path for the directory containing
    DIR.  Alternative directory names in CDPATH are separated by a colon (:).
    A null directory name is the same as the current directory.  If DIR begins
    with a slash (/), then CDPATH is not used.
    
    If the directory is not found, and the shell option `cdable_vars' is set,
    the word is assumed to be  a variable name.  If that variable has a value,
    its value is used for DIR.
    
    Options:
      -L    force symbolic links to be followed: resolve symbolic
            links in DIR after processing instances of `..'
      -P    use the physical directory structure without following
            symbolic links: resolve symbolic links in DIR before
            processing instances of `..'
      -e    if the -P option is supplied, and the current working
            directory cannot be determined successfully, exit with
            a non-zero status
      -@    on systems that support it, present a file with extended
            attributes as a directory containing the file attributes
    
    The default is to follow symbolic links, as if `-L' were specified.
    `..' is processed by removing the immediately previous pathname component
    back to a slash or the beginning of DIR.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns 0 if the directory is changed, and if $PWD is set successfully when
    -P is used; non-zero otherwise.
~/command-line-5-8-tliapis$ mkdir --help
Usage: mkdir [OPTION]... DIRECTORY...
Create the DIRECTORY(ies), if they do not already exist.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -m, --mode=MODE   set file mode (as in chmod), not a=rwx - umask
  -p, --parents     no error if existing, make parent directories as needed
  -v, --verbose     print a message for each created directory
  -Z                   set SELinux security context of each created directory
                         to the default type
      --context[=CTX]  like -Z, or if CTX is specified then set the SELinux
                         or SMACK security context to CTX
      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit
